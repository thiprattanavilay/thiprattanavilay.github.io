<p>MeMe grew up in Nebraska and moved to Georgia after college. She has 7 years of Photography experience while she worked full time in data analytics. As her photography business started up, she did all the marketing, branding, and website designs herself as well as helped friends build their brand. She holds a paralegal certificate and obtained a Bachelors in Business Management. She leads projects and acts as the interim Public Relations person for CTP.</p>
<p>She currently resides in Orange County, California. She has three grown children, 3 dogs and 4 bunnies. Her style is more sporty, bohemian, and the all mighty sweatpants and tank top. She’s the one with too many hobbies to list but yet she seems to be passionate about it all, if that’s even possible.</p>
